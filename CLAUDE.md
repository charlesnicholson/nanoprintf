Build with "make -j" on POSIX systems, and "python3.13 build.py" on Windows. Generated binary size is critically important, so all changes must be correct but also minimize the footprint. Always compile for ARM, ask the user where arm-none-eabi-gcc is and evaluate the impact of your changes with -Os for cortex-m0 and cortex-m4 as part of presenting your work. nanoprintf.h is fully self-contained, do not add external helper files.
