Nanoprintf is dual-licensed under both the "Unlicense" and the
"Zero-Clause BSD" (0BSD) licenses. The intent of this dual-licensing
structure is to make nanoprintf as consumable as possible in as many
environments / countries / companies as possible without encumbering
users.

This license applies to all of the nanoprintf source code, build code,
and tests, with the explicit exception of doctest.h, which exists under
its own license and is included in this repository.

The text of the two licenses follows below:
