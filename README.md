nanoprintf is an almost-standard-compliant implementation of snprintf and vsnprintf for embedded systems. nanoprintf makes no memory allocations, uses less than 100 bytes of stack, and is around 5KB of ARM Cortex-M object code when optimized with all the bells and whistles turned on (slightly larger on x64).

nanoprintf is a [single header file](https://github.com/charlesnicholson/nanoprintf/blob/readme/nanoprintf.h) in the style of the [stb libraries](https://github.com/nothings/stb). The rest of the repository is tests and scaffolding and not required for use.

nanoprintf is written in C89 for maximal compiler compatibility. C99 or C++11 compilers are required (for `uint64_t` and other types) if floating point conversion or C99 modifiers are enabled. nanoprintf does include standard headers but only uses them for types and argument lists; no calls are made into stdlib / libc, with the possible exception of double-to-float conversion.

nanoprintf is statically configurable so users can find a balance between size, compiler requirements, and feature set. Floating point conversion, C99 length modifiers, and size write-back are all configurable and are only compiled if explicitly requested, see [Configuration](https://github.com/charlesnicholson/nanoprintf/tree/readme#configuration) for details.

## Usage

1. Copy `nanoprintf.h` into your codebase somewhere.
1. Add the following code to one of your `.c` or `.cpp` files to compile the nanoprintf implementation:

	```
	#define NANOPRINTF_IMPLEMENTATION
	#include "path/to/nanoprintf.h"
	```

1. `#include "path/to/nanoprintf.h"` as usual to expose the function prototypes.

## API

nanoprintf has 4 main functions:
* `npf_snprintf`: Use like [snprintf](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fprintf).
* `npf_vsnprintf`: Use like [vsnprintf](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/vfprintf) (`va_list` support).
* `npf_pprintf`: Use like [printf](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fprintf) with a per-character write callback (semihosting, UART, etc).
* `npf_vpprintf`: Use like `npf_pprintf` but takes a `va_list`.

The `pprintf` variations take a callback that returns an `int`. If the callback returns `NPF_EOF`, the print functions will stop printing and return immediately.

nanoprintf does *not* provide `printf` itself; that's seen as project- or platform-specific. nanoprintf is hopefully a good building block for rolling your own `printf`, though.

## Configuration

nanoprintf has the following static configuration flags. You can either inject them into your compiler (usually `-D` flags) or wrap `nanoprintf.h` in [your own header](https://github.com/charlesnicholson/nanoprintf/blob/readme/unit_tests/nanoprintf_in_unit_tests.h) that sets them up, and then `#include` your header instead of `nanoprintf.h` in your application.

* `NANOPRINTF_USE_FLOAT_FORMAT_SPECIFIERS`: Set to `0` or `1`. Enables floating-point specifiers.
* `NANOPRINTF_USE_C99_FORMAT_SPECIFIERS`: Set to `0` or `1`. Enables C99-specific modifiers.
* `NANOPRINTF_USE_WRITEBACK_FORMAT_SPECIFIERS`: Set to `0` or `1`. Enables `%n` for write-back.
* `NANOPRINTF_VISIBILITY_STATIC`: Optional define. Marks prototypes as `static` to sandbox nanoprintf.

If a disabled format specifier feature is used, no conversion will occur and the format specifier string simply will be printed instead.

## Features

Like `printf`, `nanoprintf` expects a conversion specification string of the following form:

`[flags][field width][.precision][length modifier][conversion specifier]`

* **Flags**
	
	None or more of the following:
	* `0`: Pad the field with leading zero characters.
	* `-`: Left-justify the conversion result in the field.
	* `+`: Signed conversions always begin with `+` or `-` characters.
	* ` `: (space) A space character is inserted if the first converted character is not a sign.
	* `#`: Writes extra characters (`0x` for hex, `.` for empty floats, '0' for empty octals, etc).
* **Field width**
	
	A number that specifies the total field width for the conversion, adds padding. If field width is `*`, the field width is read from the next vararg.
* **Precision**
	
	Prefixed with a `.`, a number that specifies the precision of the number or string. If precision is `*`, the precision is read from the next vararg.
* **Length modifier**
	
	None or more of the following:
	* `h`: Use `short` for integral and write-back vararg width.
	* `L`: Use `long double` for float vararg width (note: it will then be casted down to `float`)
	* `l`: Use `long`, `double`, or wide vararg width.
	* `hh`: (C99-only specifier) Use `char` for integral and write-back vararg width.
	* `ll`: (C99-only specifier) Use `long long` for integral and write-back vararg width.
	* `j`: (C99-only specifier) Use the `[u]intmax_t` types for integral and write-back vararg width.
	* `z`: (C99-only specifier) Use the `size_t` types for integral and write-back vararg width.
	* `t`: (C99-only specifier) Use the `ptrdiff_t` types for integral and write-back vararg width.
* **Conversion specifier**
	
	Exactly one of the following:
	* `%%`: Percent-sign literal
	* `%c`: Characters
	* `%s`: Null-terminated strings
	* `%i`/`%d`: Signed integers
	* `%u`: Unsigned integers
	* `%o`: Unsigned octal integers
	* `%x` / `%X`: Unsigned hexadecimal integers
	* `%p`: Pointers
	* `%n`: Write the number of bytes written to the pointer vararg
	* `%f`/`%F`: Floating-point values
